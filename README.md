# Data-Science-Development
The goal of this project was to predict the price of a laptop based on the hardware attributes by training a linear regression model. This model could be used to know if a laptop is overpriced or at what price a laptop can be sold. The project required looking for a public dataset containing the details of laptops and their price. The analysis implements the data science cycle:
	
	• Dataset Selection
	• Exploratory Data Analysis
	• Dataset Pre-processing and attribute Analysis
	• Model training
	• Model Evaluation
